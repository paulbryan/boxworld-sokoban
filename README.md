## How to Play

./boxworld.py
```

### Game Symbols

- `#` - Wall
- `$` - Box (crate)
- `.` - Goal position (target spot)
- `*` - Box on goal (box placed correctly)
- `+` - Player on goal

### Rules

1. **Objective**: Push all boxes ($) onto goal positions (.) to complete the level
2. **Movement**: The player can move in four directions (up, down, left, right)
3. **Pushing**: Boxes can only be **pushed**, not pulled
4. **Limitations**: 
   - Only one box can be moved at a time
   - You cannot push a box if there's a wall or another box behind it
   - Be careful not to push boxes into corners - they might become unmovable!
5. **Winning**: A level is complete when all boxes are on goal positions (shown as `*`)

## Game Strategy Tips

- üß† **Plan ahead**: Think several moves in advance
- üö´ **Avoid corners**: Don't push boxes into corners unless it's a goal position
- üìê **Use walls**: Use walls to your advantage for maneuvering boxes
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è **Use undo**: Don't hesitate to undo moves if you make a mistake
- üîÑ **Reset when stuck**: If you create an unsolvable position, reset the level

## Level Progression

The game includes 5 levels:

1. **Level 1**: Simple introduction - One box, one goal
2. **Level 2**: Two boxes - Learn basic pushing mechanics
3. **Level 3**: Corner challenge - Avoid dead ends
4. **Level 4**: Classic Sokoban - A traditional puzzle layout
5. **Level 5**: Tight squeeze - All boxes in a row

## Development

### Adding New Levels

        "########",
        "#  .   #",
        "#  $   #",
        "#  @   #",
        "########",
    ],
    # Add more levels here...
]
```

### Running Tests

The game includes basic functionality that can be tested:

```bash
python3 -m doctest boxworld.py -v
```

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python 3.6+
- **Dependencies**: None (uses only standard library)
